## IPL WIN PROBABILITY PREDICTION

Cricket enthusiasts often find it challenging to gauge the potential outcomes of Indian Premier 
League (IPL) matches, given the dynamic nature of the sport. The lack of a user-friendly and 
data-driven tool for predicting win probabilities hinders their ability to make informed 
predictions. This project aims to address this gap by developing an IPL Win Probability 
Predictor using machine learning and Streamlit, offering users a seamless and interactive 
platform to anticipate match results based on historical data, team dynamics, and player 
performances. The goal is to provide cricket fans with a reliable and accessible tool that 
enhances their engagement with IPL matches through real-time win probability predictions.
